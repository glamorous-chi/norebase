## Overview

### The challenge

Using the CoinLore API, create a simple web app that displays information on cryptocurrency coin prices. You can find the CoinLore API documentation here: CoinLore API Docs.

- Use the /tickers endpoint to fetch a list of coin prices.
- Display the coins in a table.
    - The table should be paginated.
    - Each page should display only ten (10) items.
    - The video linked below shows how the table should look and behave.

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid, CSS Grid properties, and Flexbox. Most importantly, I learned how to use Utility classes and Custom properties to my advantage. I also learnt how to do a reset in order to remove some default styles that came with some HTML elements. For example, HTML Paragraphs come with a default margin of 16px at the top and bottom, and a reset removes such, so I can give my own styles as I wish.


### Continued development

I will love to sharpen my skills when it comes to building a good design structure however the Layout may be i.e following a Mobile-first design approach whilst keeping my Desktop design in mind. Essentially, learning to see the bigger pcture and not focusing just on my Mobile design but seeing how my desktop design layout differs from my Mobile design layout and ensuring that both designs come out well while building.
