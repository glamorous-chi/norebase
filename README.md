## Overview

### The challenge

Using the CoinLore API, create a simple web app that displays information on cryptocurrency coin prices. You can find the CoinLore API documentation here: CoinLore API Docs.

- Use the /tickers endpoint to fetch a list of coin prices.
- Display the coins in a table.
    - The table should be paginated.
    - Each page should display only ten (10) items.
    - The video linked below shows how the table should look and behave.
